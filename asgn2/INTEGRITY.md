I used the following resources to complete this assignment:

* I used Claude.ai to implement the pyramid shape to use as the head. The prompt I used was "Make me a pyramid with a square base. <insert Triangle.js>"

* I also used Claude.ai to implement the rotation circle because the slider taught in the video didn't give me enough range of motion to view all sides of the fish.

* I used GitHub CoPilot to assist me in doing the rotation/movement of each body segment

* I did the poke animation myself, but I couldn't figure out the correct colors for the rainbow animation so I plugged my getRainborColor() function into claude and had it finc out the color combinations for me.
