I used the following sources to implement my program:

* I used Claude.ai to implement a few of the creation of buttons in my HTML file, such as the ON/OFF toggle switches for Normals, Light, Spotlight, Animation, and Wall Height by asking "Can you turn my buttons into toggle switches <insert index.html> <insert World.js> <insert BlockyWorld.html>"

* I also used Claude.ai to debug my ambient, diffuse, specular, and spotlight shaders by asking "My lighting isn't working properly can you fix it for me <insert World.js>"
