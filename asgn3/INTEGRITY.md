I used the following sources to implement my program:

* I used Claude.ai to fix the texturing of my ground because it kept on using the texture for the walls on the ground for some reason. I asked it "Can you change the texture for my ground to be a solid green? <insert BlockyWorld.js> <insert World.js>" and it just broke it even more so I just uploaded another texture to use as the ground because it didn't seem to like solid colors

* I used Claude.ai to build the randomization function for the maze by asking it "Can you make it so that everytime the browser is refreshed, the walls are randomly placed with a 5x5 flat plane to indicate the goal? <insert BlockyWorld.js>"
