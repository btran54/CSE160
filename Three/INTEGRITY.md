I used these resources for my implementations:

* I used Claude.ai to help me create the "Tower of Hanoi" toy object by asking "Can you create me a Tower of Hanoi object using the current shapes as reference? <insert main.js>"

* I used Claude.ai to handle a problem with the window resize where the entire canvas would shrink if I fullscreen-ed the webpage
